# EDA on Daily Delhi Climate Data

This repository contains the code and analysis for the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) performed on the Daily Delhi Climate dataset. This project marks my first endeavor into data analysis, aiming to uncover insights and patterns in the climate data of Delhi.

## Project Overview

### Objective

The primary objective of this project is to perform a thorough exploratory data analysis on the Daily Delhi Climate dataset. This involves:
- Understanding the structure and content of the dataset.
- Cleaning and preprocessing the data.
- Conducting univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis.
- Visualizing the data to uncover trends and patterns.

### Dataset

The dataset contains daily climate records for Delhi, including variables such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation.

## Files in the Repository

- `EDA_DailyDelhiClimate.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete EDA workflow.
- `dailydelhiclimate.csv`: The dataset used for the analysis (ensure to include the data file if it's not too large, or provide instructions to download it).
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python packages required to run the analysis.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. You can install the required Python packages using the provided `requirements.txt` file.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/kevin06055/Exploratory-Data-Analysis.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd Exploratory-Data-Analysis
    ```
3. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook EDA_Project_(Final).ipynb
    ```
2. Follow the steps in the notebook to perform the EDA.

## Analysis Overview

### Data Cleaning

- Handling missing values.
- Converting data types.
- Removing duplicates.

### Exploratory Analysis

- **Univariate Analysis**: Analyzing individual variables to understand their distribution and identify outliers.
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Examining relationships between pairs of variables using scatter plots, correlation matrices, and other visualization techniques.
- **Multivariate Analysis**: Exploring interactions between multiple variables to uncover complex patterns.

### Key Insights

- **Temperature Trends**: Identified seasonal variations and trends in temperature.
- **Humidity Patterns**: Analyzed the distribution and changes in humidity levels over time.
- **Wind Speed and Direction**: Investigated wind speed patterns and their correlation with other climatic factors.
- **Precipitation Analysis**: Studied rainfall patterns and their impact on other climate variables.

## Results

The EDA revealed significant patterns and insights into the climate of Delhi, which can be valuable for further analysis, forecasting, and decision-making.

## Conclusion

This project provided a comprehensive understanding of the Daily Delhi Climate data and demonstrated the importance of EDA in uncovering meaningful insights from raw data. As my first data analysis project, it laid a strong foundation for future analytical endeavors.
